# Python OOP Assignments for Beginners 🐍

Simple Python assignments to learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Assignment 1: Simple Smartphone Class 📱

**File:** `assignment_1_smartphone_class.py`

### What You'll Learn:

- Creating classes and objects
- Using constructors (`__init__`)
- Basic inheritance (child classes inherit from parent)
- Simple methods and attributes

### Classes:

- `Smartphone` - Basic phone with turn on/off, calls, messages
- `AndroidPhone` - Inherits from Smartphone + Google Play Store
- `iPhone` - Inherits from Smartphone + App Store

### How to Run:

```bash
python assignment_1_smartphone_class.py
```

## Assignment 2: Simple Polymorphism 🎭

**File:** `assignment_2_polymorphism_challenge.py`

### What You'll Learn:

- Polymorphism (same method name, different behaviors)
- How different classes can have the same method name
- Using lists with different object types

### Classes:

**Animals:**

- `Dog` - runs on four legs
- `Bird` - flies in the sky
- `Fish` - swims in water

**Vehicles:**

- `Car` - drives on roads
- `Plane` - flies through clouds
- `Boat` - sails on water

### How to Run:

```bash
python assignment_2_polymorphism_challenge.py
```

## Key Concepts Learned ✅

1. **Classes and Objects** - Creating blueprints and instances
2. **Constructors** - Using `__init__()` to set up objects
3. **Inheritance** - Child classes get features from parent classes
4. **Polymorphism** - Same method name, different behaviors
5. **Methods** - Functions inside classes
6. **Attributes** - Variables inside classes

## Example Output

### Assignment 1:

```
📱 Phone 1: Samsung Galaxy A54 (Blue)
📱 Phone 2: Apple iPhone 13 (Red)

🔌 Turning on phones:
📱 Galaxy A54 is now ON!
📱 iPhone 13 is now ON!

📱 Downloading apps:
📱 Downloading Instagram from Google Play Store
📱 Downloading Instagram from App Store
```

### Assignment 2:

```
🐾 ANIMALS:
🐕 Buddy is running on four legs!
🐦 Eagle is flying in the sky!
🐠 Nemo is swimming in the water!

🚗 VEHICLES:
🚗 Honda Civic is driving on the road!
✈️ Boeing 747 is flying through the clouds!
🚤 Yacht is sailing on the water!
```

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Download the files
3. Run the assignments:
   ```bash
   python assignment_1_smartphone_class.py
   python assignment_2_polymorphism_challenge.py
   ```

## What's Next?

After mastering these basics, you can:

- Add more methods to the classes
- Create more child classes
- Add private attributes (using `__` prefix)
- Try creating your own classes for books, cars, or games!

Happy coding! 🚀
